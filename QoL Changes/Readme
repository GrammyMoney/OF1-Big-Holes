Added larger holes (1.0mm) to the TP2/TP3 solder points for the pico footprint. Should make the "fast and cheap" way described in the Readme file significantly more accessible to beginner solderers, and even for seasoned solderers.

Added an extra footprint for a WASD layout, compatible with Bubblebox WASD. Link to firmware can be found in the readme at the root level of this fork.
